# L0 Error Catalog

Errors caught during development by term-level verification.  Each
entry records the error, how it hid from higher-level tests, the L0
test that caught it, and the lesson learned.

This file is the primary QA publication artifact.  It supersedes
``gotchas.md`` (deleted).

## Error Classification

Errors are classified by the 6 AI Failure Modes taxonomy:

| # | Mode | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | Sign flip | `(a − b)` vs `(b − a)` |
| 2 | Variable swap | `mu_x` vs `mu_y`, `h_sat_l` vs `h_sat_v` |
| 3 | Missing factor | Missing `2×`, `ΔA/w`, volume |
| 4 | Factor error | Wrong constant, hardcoded value |
| 5 | Index error | `face[i]` vs `face[i+1]` |
| 6 | Convention drift | Definition site vs usage site disagree |

## ERR-001 — Z-ordinate weight loss in 2D Lebedev sweep

**Failure mode:** #3 Missing factor — missing contribution  
**Date:** 2026-04-03  
**Solver:** SN (Cartesian 2D)

**Bug:** In `_sweep_2d_wavefront`, ordinates with `mu_x = mu_y = 0`
(z-directed) were skipped with `continue`.  Their quadrature weights
(0.77% of total) were lost from scalar flux integration.

**Impact:** Multi-group eigenvalue error of ~0.4% (2G: 1.867 vs 1.875).

**How it hid from higher-level tests:**
- 1-group keff = νΣ_f/Σ_a is independent of weight loss (cancels)
- Spatial convergence showed the scheme converged — to the wrong value
- "Reasonable numbers" — 0.4% looks like discretization error

**L0 test that catches it:** L0-SN-001 (streaming equilibrium) — the
volume-averaged φ would deviate from Q/Σ_t by the missing weight
fraction.

**Lesson:** 1-group eigenvalue tests are degenerate.  Always verify
with ≥2 groups.

## ERR-002 — Scattering matrix transpose in vectorization

**Failure mode:** #2 Variable swap — `SigS` vs `SigS^T`  
**Date:** 2026-04-03  
**Solver:** SN (all geometries)

**Bug:** Vectorized `_add_scattering_source` used `phi @ SigS^T`
(double-transposed) instead of `phi @ SigS`.

**Impact:** keff = 2.06 (catastrophically wrong) — caught immediately.

**How it could hide:** For symmetric scattering matrices (1-group
self-scatter), SigS = SigS^T and the bug is invisible.

**L0 test that catches it:** L0-SN-009 (scattering source magnitude)
— hand-calculated SigS^T @ φ vs code output with asymmetric 2G matrix.

**Lesson:** Always test with asymmetric inputs.  The identity
`(A^T v) = (v^T A)^T` means the transpose moves sides, not into
a pre-transposed matrix.

## ERR-003 — Octant batching breaks reflective BC ordering

**Failure mode:** #6 Convention drift — implicit ordinate ordering  
**Date:** 2026-04-03  
**Solver:** SN (Cartesian 2D)

**Bug:** Batching ordinates by sweep direction changed the order in
which reflective BC boundary fluxes were updated.  A group reads
boundary fluxes that its reflected group hasn't updated yet.

**Impact:** 2G convergence test failed (keff diffs grew).

**How it hid:** 1G converged; the optimization gave 2× speedup
on the passing test.

**L0 test that catches it:** Not directly an L0 problem (this is
a coupling issue between ordinates).  Caught by L1: eigenvalue
convergence with mesh refinement.

**Lesson:** Sequential processing order is part of the interface
contract for reflective BCs.  Don't parallelize without verifying
the data dependency.

## ERR-004 — Hardcoded 4π in BiCGSTAB RHS normalization

**Failure mode:** #4 Factor error — wrong normalization constant  
**Date:** 2026-04-03  
**Solver:** SN BiCGSTAB (spherical)

**Bug:** `build_rhs` hardcoded `4π` for angular normalization.
Correct for Lebedev (sum(w) = 4π), wrong for GL (sum(w) = 2).

**Impact:** BiCGSTAB on GL diverged (keff oscillating).

**How it hid:** All initial BiCGSTAB testing used Lebedev where
4π is correct.

**L0 test that catches it:** L0-SN-001 (streaming equilibrium)
with BiCGSTAB solver — φ would not converge to Q/Σ_t with wrong
normalization.

**Lesson:** Never hardcode quadrature-dependent constants.

## ERR-005 — DD recurrence rewrite breaks multi-group convergence

**Failure mode:** #4 Factor error — numerically unstable rewrite  
**Date:** 2026-04-04  
**Solver:** SN (Cartesian 1D)

**Bug:** Algebraically equivalent rewrite of `_solve_recurrence`
introduced catastrophic cancellation: `2*(…) − psi_in` subtracts
nearly-equal large numbers.

**Impact:** Multi-group scattering iteration diverged (~1e34/iter).

**How it hid:** 1-group unaffected; formulas are algebraically
identical; 2D wavefront (different code path) still passed.

**L0 test that catches it:** Not a single-term issue; caught by
L1 (multi-group eigenvalue convergence).

**Lesson:** "Algebraically equivalent" ≠ "numerically equivalent".
The stable form `0.5*(psi_in + psi_out)` averages known quantities;
the unstable form subtracts large numbers.

## ERR-006 — Wrong α recursion + missing ΔA/w in curvilinear sweep

**Failure mode:** #2 Variable swap + #3 Missing factor  
**Date:** 2026-04-04  
**Solver:** SN (cylindrical, spherical)

**Bug:** Two simultaneous bugs:
1. α recursion used `cumsum(+w·ξ)` with azimuthal cosine mu_y
   instead of `cumsum(−w·η)` with radial cosine mu_x
2. Missing `ΔA_i/w_m` geometry factor on the redistribution term

**Impact:** Heterogeneous keff diverged with mesh refinement
(1.15 → 0.90 → 0.52 → 0.25).  Spherical had flux spike 5.1× at r=0.

**How it hid from 20 passing tests:**
- Homogeneous eigenvalue: exact (redistribution cancels for flat flux)
- 1-group: degenerate (keff = material ratio)
- Particle balance: exact (telescoping is by construction)
- Conservation: exact (total is correct; per-ordinate is wrong)
- Flux non-negativity: no negatives produced
- Single sweep finite: fluxes are finite, just wrong

**L0 tests that catch it:**
- L0-SN-003 (per-ordinate flat-flux) — streaming + redistribution ≠ 0
  per ordinate without ΔA/w.  This is the definitive L0 diagnostic.
- L0-SN-001 (streaming equilibrium) — flux spike at r=0 visible
- L0-SN-008 (contamination β) — β ≈ 2.0 instead of ~0

**Investigation history:** 6 approaches failed before root cause found:
reverse sweep, step closure, starting direction, bidirectional sweep,
scaled α, zero redistribution.  Full details in
`docs/theory/discrete_ordinates.rst` §Investigation History.

**Lesson:** Per-ordinate flat-flux consistency (L0-SN-003) is the
FUNDAMENTAL correctness criterion for curvilinear SN.  It should be
the first test written for any curvilinear transport implementation.

## ERR-007 — Multi-group BiCGSTAB unstable for spherical geometry

**Failure mode:** #3 Missing factor — same as ERR-006  
**Date:** 2026-04-05  
**Solver:** SN BiCGSTAB (spherical, cylindrical)

**Bug:** The explicit FD transport operator was missing the same
ΔA/w geometry factor as the sweep (ERR-006).

**Impact:** Multi-group BiCGSTAB diverged for spherical (keff → NaN).
Previously documented as "BiCGSTAB is unreliable for curvilinear"
when the real issue was a missing geometry factor.

**L0 test that catches it:** L0-SN-003 applied to the operator output.

**Lesson:** When a bug is found in one code path (sweep), check ALL
code paths that implement the same physics (BiCGSTAB operator).

## Meta-Lessons

1. **1-group is degenerate.** k = νΣ_f/Σ_a regardless of flux shape.
   Every solver MUST be verified at ≥2 groups.

2. **Homogeneous is degenerate.** Redistribution cancels for flat flux.
   Every curvilinear solver MUST be verified on heterogeneous problems.

3. **Per-ordinate consistency is fundamental.** L0-SN-003 would have
   caught ERR-006 (the most expensive bug) immediately.

4. **20 passing tests don't mean correct.** The cylindrical sweep
   passed 20 tests including homogeneous exact, particle balance, and
   conservation.  The bug survived because none tested what mattered:
   heterogeneous eigenvalue convergence with mesh refinement.

5. **Test with the pathological case.** Every physics feature has a
   regime where bugs are exposed.  For curvilinear: test near r=0 with
   mesh refinement.  For scattering: test with asymmetric matrices.
   For normalization: test with multiple quadrature types.
